# Number of entries refers to the number of rows (or cols) retained in each
# distance matrix after filtering the distance matrices to include only those
# samples that were in both distance matrices. p-value contains the correct
# number of significant digits.
# Distance classes with values of None were in the second half of the distance
# classes and not all samples could be included in the distance class, so
# calculations were not performed.
